# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, I created the code that trains the AI agent to learn how to travel through the maze. This code used Deep Q-Learning to explore the maze and then exploit to find the best path to the treasure.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists research and discover new ways to solve problems by utilizing computers and technology. In regards to this course, AI Scientists are using different AI techniques and network architectures to solve complex problems that do not typically have a traditional solution for solving them.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
For me personally, I approach computer science problems with the tools I currently have available and try to think of the best solution to achieve my goal. This may involve further research to learn how to best utilize the tool, however I will dig deep into the problem by looking at similar examples and learn new tools to solve the problem presented to me.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to focus on privacy and compliance concerns. With systems such as AI systems, user privacy is highly important since these systems rely on so much data. Ensuring that the data I use has been granted permission to do so and that it is highly protected is crucial in maintaining user trust. To maintain organizational trust, it is also crucial to follow compliance concerns and ensure that all code systems are being compliant.
